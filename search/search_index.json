Side Panel Located in the Properties Panel of 3D View, Tap To Automate to get started and you'll see following tool menus. 3D Object Tools Rename : Select Two Object and press Rename , It Renames the active Object and add '_LP' suffix to it and '_HP' suffix to the other selected object Rename Operator requires two selected object to make a Low-High Object named Pair On Press of Rename, the active Object (named \"Cube\") get renamed to Cube + \"_LP\" ( Low Suffix ) and second selected object get renamed Cube + \"_HP\" (High Suffix) Resulting name of active_object becomes from \"Cube\" to \"Cube_LP\" and for second selected object \"Cube_HP\", High_name = Low_object_name + high_suffix Object Organize Method Method to Organize: OP1 : Separate Low-High: When pressed Rename, Moves the Low and High suffix objects to the individual Low_Col and High_Col Collections respectively. Toggle the Check in front of LP Col and HP Col to disable moving to collection. OP2 : Object Collection: When pressed Rename, Moves both the Low and High suffixed objects to a new Object's name Collection. Example: Resulting \"Cube_LP\" and \"Cube_HP\" Objects will both be in Collection \"Cube\" . Selection Menu : OP1 : To Check if an object's counterpart (Low or high) exists. OP2 : To Check if any object doesn't have it's Counterpart (Low or high) and select them. Note : Works with respect to defined/named LP Col and HP Col in Organize Method Collection Organizer : Converts the Blender's Collection Heirarchy to Empty object-parent collection for the collection tree, Helpful when want to preserve heirarchy for .fbx or other 3D softwares. Source Col : Select a Source Collection to Convert to Empty-object Parent heirarchy. Parent : Toggle Parent if we want an external Empty-Object that will go on top of the Final src Collection object. Name : Give a name for the External Parent Object, If doesn't exist, will create it Organize : Press Organize and convert your Collection Heirarchy into empty-parent heirarchy Mesh Menu Modifiers : Overview: Applies the following Modifiers to all selected objects. Create New : If the object already have selected modifier, It'll create an additional new modifier. Helpful when need multiple Mirror Modifiers. TRIANGULATE : Apply to all objects, keeps mesh clean to edit and prepared for export and baking. Adds a triangulate modifier, with keep normals toggled On (Helpful in keeping normals consistent). MIRROR : Adds a Mirror Modifier to selected object, with some additional properties as a pop up menu. Opens an Additional Dialogue menu to select the Mirror Origin (A symmetry Object in world center). Or to Select axis for the mirror. Applies to all selected objects Dynamic Array : It's not normal array, it needs two objects specifically. What it does basically is: Requirements : The active object and a second selected object Dynamic Array calculates the 3D Distance between both objects and adds an array to active object that makes it's Array distance to the calculated distance above. Weighted Normal : Adds Weighted Normal to all the selected objects. SHIFT UV : Helpful for Mirrors and Arrays, When in game object baking, having mirror for each object, can result in Overlap UVs, so enable SHIFT_UV, and select U or V or both to shift the Mirrored-part's UV out of 1:1 to avoid overlap in main baking region. Materials Material : Select a Material from Scene Delete Old Material : Toggle ON to remove old materials of an object, when adding material from below. Add Material : Adds selected Material in Material to all selected objects. If no Material was selected, a pop-up will come up that asks for a name for the New Material to add to the objects.

Note: All the empty objects will follow the heirarchy of the Collection tree of Blender Scene. So, if blender scene has multiple collection, instead of one base collection of tree. That will lead to creation of 3-different heirarchy. That's why there is an option to create an Parent object to make those 3 Empty object under one. Collection De-Organizer Collection De-Organizer helps in deorganizing empty-object parent heirachy and converts them to Blender Collection system.

ToAutomate is a Blender addon aimed to optimize the 3D-Art workflows in real production workflow. It is an ever-evolving addon which tackles various stages of production that could be optimized to simplify repetetive tasks and give artist freedom to focus more on creative work. Tools like: a. Renaming objects for LP/HP Baking stages. b. Pre-bake mesh Check, Collection Organizer. c. Add Modifier for group objects. d. UV/UVMap tools. e. Export Collection with Different Presets Developed by me, I work as a freelance Vehicle Artist, trying to adapt to my different clients, I always strive to improve my workflows to set a modular workflow that fits everyone and hope to impprove the 3D workflow with each encounter. Getting Started Download and Installation Install from our github or gumroad, gumroad is helpful just in case you wanna be notified of new releases. Github Gumroad After downloading, the addon can be installed with following steps: 1. Open Blender and go to Edit > Preferences > addons. 2. Click at Install from FIle and locate the pacakge ToAutomate.zip file in the newly opened window. 3. The addon should now appear in your addons list and can be activated. Please contact me in case you run into any issues. Feature Overview 3D Object Operators: Renamer Operator to convert to rename two objects as Low and High, with suffix Active object gets renamed to obj_LP , and selected object gest obj_HP . Suffix are changeable for both. Organize Menu : It moves the Low-poly and High-poly objects into their respective collection. Selection Menu : Helps Checking if `Low and High objects have their respective counter-part. Collection Organizer : Organizes the Blender Collection Heirarchy and creates respective empty-parent heirarchy useful when exporting to softwares like max and game engines. Collection DeOrganizer : Deorganizes the Empty-parent Heirarchy and Converts it to Blender Collection System. Mesh Operators: Modifiers List: Applies given modifiers to the all selected-objects. Helpful to apply modifiers to group/multiple objects. Settings Some Modifier has additional pop-up setting upon applying, for adjustments. Materials Simply Add, Delete, or Remove Unused Materials to selected objects Works in Edit-Mode too, selected faces get applied the materials selected. UV Operators: UV Offset : Checks whether selected objects has Mirror/Array UV-Offset on or not. Helpful so during baking, we don't weird artifacts cuz of Overlap-UV Add UV Offset : Adds UV offset to selected objects' modifiers: Array and Mirror Split Island Check : Not perfect, But checks if there are any islands that are split. Seams Menu : Mark Boundary of selected faces as seam, or mark sharp edges as seam UVMap Menu : Create , Rename or Delete UV Maps Check UV Operators Page for all functionality Export System: Export Menu : Start by Pressing: Add Preset and change settings for your first export preset. Why Object Renamer Tools? The tool is oriented towards production stages where efficiency/speed is appreciated. I can't force any of my workflows or tools to anyone. But I am pretty sure, trying out these features for yourself can save a minute or two during each iteration of workflow and when iterating multiple times, it is a considerable amount of time. Like finding which Low poly object doesn't have it's High Poly created or named wrongly in collection of 100 of objects or checking for multiple mesh of same LP/HP relationship. Exporting Specific Collections for Normal-Baking , and different final mesh for Exporting . Option to exclude any child Collection from it's Parent Collection Export, just define a quick preset in Export Manager for the workflow and it will export the collection tree without you manually selecting each collection each time. UV-Tools UV Tools to help check whether every Baking objects has their Mirror/Array modifiers have offset, so they don't bake artifacts by mistake due to inverted mesh overlapping. At the end of the day, we want to work on our projects/task, with minimum bugs less friction in export and baking mesh just to find out that some random mesh wasn't named properly or somehow that one didn't have UV offset leading to Artifacts, that cycle can go repeatedly and in a game-dev environment can be frustrating. Test the addon and find it for yourself, If you have more ideas, Suggest them and we'll do best to implement them.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"Toautomate_Intro/#toautomate","text":"","title":"ToAutomate"},{"location":"Toautomate_Intro/#overview","text":"ToAuotmate has a simple goal, to streamline and automate the repeating process of 3D production work.
