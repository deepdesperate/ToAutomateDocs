Initially I wandered in 3D for years learning mutliple workflows of different field from modelling to 3D rendering, and the stuff in the middle too. I decided to hone my skills in game-industry with focus to Vehicles.       <p>My recent professional projects include the BeamNG Hirochi-Aurata UTV vehice, BeamNG trailers, Cement Mixer. Other Car projects for Leartes Studios and QORPO. Apart from my professional work, I love to do programming on the side that helps me with problem-solving in different scenarios. I originally started with C++. But for scripting I learned python. I got started in blender script development after I had a small idea of renaming two objects using blender-script Rename using Python.  Thanks to the answer by Marty Fotus.  I had gotten a baseline to start my tools development. My Object renamer still has parts from his code as a tribute to his help.</p> <p>In my day to day work, I note down things which I can further improve and workflows that needs some automation. I want the artist to create and let the scripts and addons do the heavy-lifting to organizing, managing collection heirarchy and export system. I am still trying to find users for my script. So if someone is reading this, I am really thankful. Hope it helped you in some way.</p>"},{"location":"#portfolio","title":"Portfolio","text":"<ul> <li>Artstation</li> <li>Sketchfab</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#addon-links","title":"Addon Links","text":"<ul> <li>Github</li> <li>Gumroad</li> </ul>"},{"location":"TAMT_UI/","title":"User Interface","text":"<p>The ToAutomate UI is located in the Properties(Press N) Panel of the 3D-View.</p>"},{"location":"TAMT_UI/#side-panel","title":"Side Panel","text":"<p>  Located in the Properties Panel of 3D View, Tap <code>To Automate</code> to get started and you'll see following tool menus.</p>"},{"location":"TAMT_UI/#3d-object-tools","title":"3D Object Tools","text":"<ol> <li> <p>Rename: Select Two Object and press <code>Rename</code>, It Renames the active Object and add '_LP' suffix to it and '_HP' suffix to the other selected object</p> <ol> <li>Rename Operator requires two selected object to make a Low-High Object named Pair</li> <li>On Press of Rename, the active Object (named \"Cube\") get renamed to Cube + \"_LP\" (<code>Low Suffix</code>) and second selected object get renamed Cube + \"_HP\" (High Suffix)</li> <li>Resulting name of active_object becomes from \"Cube\" to \"Cube_LP\"     and for <code>second</code> selected object \"Cube_HP\", High_name = Low_object_name + high_suffix</li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Object Organize Method</p> <ol> <li>Method to Organize: <ol> <li><code>OP1</code>: Separate Low-High:  When pressed Rename, Moves the Low and High suffix objects to the individual <code>Low_Col</code> and <code>High_Col</code> Collections respectively.
