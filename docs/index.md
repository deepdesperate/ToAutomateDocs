# About Me

Greetings,

I am **Naman Deep**, a freelance 3D generalist specialized in 3D Vehicles and part-time programmer from Delhi, India. Initially I wandered in 3D for years learning mutliple workflows of different field from modelling to 3D rendering, and the stuff in the middle too. I decided to hone my skills in game-industry with focus to Vehicles after I read an article from Karol Miklas about game-dev Vehicles. ![Profile](/assets/images/Profile.png)

My recent professional projects include the BeamNG *Hirochi-Aurata* UTV vehice, BeamNG trailers, Cement Mixer. Other Car projects for Leartes Studios and QORPO.

Apart from my professional work, I love to do programming on the side that helps me with problem-solving in different scenarios. I originally started with C++. But for scripting I learned python. I got started in blender script development after I had a small idea of renaming two objects using blender-script [Rename using Python](https://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/248812/script-to-rename-selected-object-same-as-the-active-object-plus-a-suffix). 
Thanks to the answer by **Marty Fotus**. 
I had gotten a baseline to start my tools development. My Object renamer still has parts from his code as a tribute to his help.

In my day to day work, I note down things which I can further improve and workflows that needs some automation. I want the artist to create and let the scripts and addons do the heavy-lifting to organizing, managing collection heirarchy and export system. I am still trying to find users for my script. So if someone is reading this, I am really thankful. Hope it helped you in some way.
