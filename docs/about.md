        Greetings,<br>
        I am Naman Deep, a freelance 3D generalist specialized in 3D Vehicles and part-time programmer from Delhi, India. Initially I wandered in 3D for years learning mutliple workflows of different field from modelling to 3D rendering, and the stuff in the middle too. I decided to hone my skills in game-industry with focus to Vehicles. My recent professional projects include the BeamNG *Hirochi-Aurata* UTV vehice, BeamNG trailers, Cement Mixer. Other Car projects for Leartes Studios and QORPO.
        Apart from my professional work, I love to do programming on the side that helps me with problem-solving in different scenarios. 
        I originally started with C++. But for scripting I learned python. I got started in blender script development after I had a small idea of renaming two objects using blender-script.
        I had gotten a simple addon skeleton to start my tools development. My Object renamer(now **ToAutomate**) is here for everyone.

In my day to day work, I note down things which I can further improve and workflows that needs some automation. I want the artist to create and let the scripts and addons do the heavy-lifting to organizing, managing collection heirarchy and export system. I am still trying to find users for my script. So if someone is reading this, I am really thankful. Hope it helped you in some way.
